    <h1>Image types and formats</h1>
    <p>In computers we have two types of images</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>RASTER</h2>
            <p>Made up of pixels. Raster images often come from cameras and scanners but they can also be produced in
                software. Any file with the extension of JPG, PNG, GIF is a raster image. We use these images for
                displaying photos.
                More pixels => More large files
            </p>
            <img src="./images/rasterImages.PNG" alt="An image represententing requirements of type of images">
        <li>
            <h2>VECTOR</h2>
            <p>Are defined by a set of mathematical vectors like lines and curves. Vector images are exported from
                drawing tools like Adobe Illustrator. Files with the SVG extension represent vector graphics. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
